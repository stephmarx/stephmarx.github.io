				<h2>Humble Hearts site - May 2015 </h2>
				<p>A website donated to the Humble Hearts Foundation and constructed during the Nerdery Overnight Website Challenge. This site was created in just 24 hours by a team of ten developers, all graduates of Dev Bootcamp. I worked as a front-end developer for this project, working with our designer to finalize the user interface. I also adapted the original designs for mobile and helped architect the initial back end of the application.</p>
				<p>This site uses Ruby on Rails, HTML5, SCSS, and jQuery.</p>

				<h2>Dead City Productions' Character System - August 2015 to October 2015 </h2>
				<p>Myself and a team of two other developers created the character creation and management system used by Dead City Productions, which is a live-action roleplaying group based out of Northwestern University. This application uses Ruby on Rails, SLIM, Sass, and significant amounts of jQuery. The Foundation framework is used, as well as the Datatables gem.</p>
				<p>I led the design of the user interface for this site, including user flow maps and mockups. I assisted in back-end coding and database design of this site, and mentored another developer in learning Ruby on Rails as part of this project.</p>

				<h2>Infinite Mysteries, Character System - December 2015 to present </h2>
				<p>A Ruby on Rails application used to manage characters and faciliate character creation for the Infinite Mysteries roleplaying game system. This application is still in development and is a collaboration between myself and another Rails developer. </p>
				<p>I designed the user interface for this site and coded the front end, as well as assisting on database design and back end implementation with Rails. This site uses SLIM, Sass, and jQuery and is free of front end frameworks.</p>

        <h2>Infinite Mysteries, Main Site - January 2016 to present</h2>
        <p>An informational site for the Infinite Mysteries roleplaying system. When released, it will contain a rules repository, a developer diary, and a calendar of upcoming games. This site is being developed with another Ruby on Rails developer and a non-technical, game design team. I am responsible for UI design and front end for this site.</p>

        <h2>LARP Sampler Informational Site - September 2015</h2>
        <p>A single page, informational website for an educational live-action roleplaying event. Potential participants were directed to this site to learn more about the event and determine games they would like to play.</p>
				<p>I designed and coded this site, using SLIM, Sass, and some elements of the Foundation framework. I designed flyers to be handed out and complement the informational site. I also drafted and revised the copy for the site based on feedback from the event team.</p>

        <h2>Photoplop - April 2015</h2>
        <p>Photoplop was built as my final project during Dev Bootcamp and was created by myself and two other students in less than eight days. Photoplop is a mobile-first web app built with Ruby On Rails, that enables users to collaboratively build photo albums. Other technologies used include Cloudinary, Instagram API, Foundation and Omniauth.</p>
				<p>I designed the user interface and implemented the front end design using HTML, SCSS, the Foundation framework, and Javascript. I was also involved in other aspects of the application, such as integrating with the Instagram API, database construction, and back end coding in Ruby on Rails. I led the creation of user flow maps, created mockups, and scripted and led user testing.</p>

	<div class="right-content">
		<p>I am currently employed as a Ruby on Rails application developer and specialize in HTML/CSS and design. I enjoy using SLIM, Sass, Sketch, and other technologies that start with the letter S. I'm particularly passionate about accessibility, object oriented CSS, and user interface design.</p>
		<p>I enjoy the process of understanding a user's needs, developing a solution to those needs, testing the solution, and integrating results from user testing to create an even better solution. I can tell the user story eloquently, both in person and through visual media. I love to craft positive user experiences and help users understand and embrace provided solutions.</p>
		<p>I am an alumnus of Dev Bootcamp Chicago and the Illinois Institute of Technology. I have a degree in psychology and have taken extensive coursework in physics and mathematics. Ask me how language impacts the way you see color, why some infinities are bigger than others, or what happens when you lose your sense of proprieoception.</p>
		<p>In the past, I've shipped library books across the world, designed and printed business cards just in time for your big meeting, fit wigs on children and drag queens, and rapped about poop for a living. I've died in several plays and killed off dozens of characters in roleplaying games.</p>
