		<h1>Hi, my name is Stephanie Marx. I'm a web developer and designer.</h1>
		<p>I am currently employed as an Ruby on Rails application developer and specialize in HTML/CSS and design. I enjoy using SLIM, Sass, Sketch, and other technologies that start with the letter S. I'm particularly passionate about accessibility, object oriented CSS, and user interface design.</p>
		<p>I enjoy the process of understanding a user's needs, developing a solution to those needs, testing the solution, and integrating results from user testing to create an even better solution. I can tell the user story eloquently, both in person and through visual media. I love to craft positive user experiences and help users understand and embrace provided solutions.</p>
		<p>I am an alumnus of Dev Bootcamp Chicago and the Illinois Institute of Technology. I have a degree in psychology and have taken extensive coursework in physics and mathematics. Ask me how language impacts the way you see color, why some infinities are bigger than others, or what happens when you lose your sense of proprieoception.</p>
		<p>In the past, I've shipped library books across the world, designed and printed business cards just in time for your big meeting, fit wigs on children and drag queens, and rapped about poop for a living. I've died in several plays and killed off dozens of characters in roleplaying games.</p>
		<p>Wanna chat?</p>
