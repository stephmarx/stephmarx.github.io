        <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming is collaboration towards a single goal. Two programmers work together on the same part of the problem to find a solution. In a typical pair programming setup, the common dynamic is for there to be one person guiding the process (the navigator) and on person physically creating the code (the driver).</p>
        
        <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
        <p>Pair programming is very important to DBC for a variety of reason. Primarily, programming in pairs is a very effective use of our learning time, as it allows us to learn more quickly through collaborating with another person. In addition, programming is a team activity and, after DBC, we will be working with others to code and will need to know how to communicate about programming. Pair programming also fosters a community mindset and allows us to understand one another better.</p>
        
        <h3>Driver vs. Navigator</h3>
        <p>There are many different ways to define the roles of navigator and driver. In some pair dynamics, the navigator directs all of the driver's actions and manages everything about the code. In other pairs, the role of the driver is a tactical role in implementing the strategy crafted the navigator. In any scenario, the idea is that two people establish a rapport and work together to accomplish their goal.</p>
