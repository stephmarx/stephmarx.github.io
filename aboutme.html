			<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
			<p>I'm a gamer nerd with a psych degree from Chicago who likes to make shiny things with code and organize things by color.</p>
			<h3>A Lot About Me</h3>
			<p>My passion lies at the intersection of technology and roleplaying games. I love the use of the web to facilitate in-person interaction and gaming experiences. Scheduling app to decide when your next campaign session will be? Awesome! Forums to help you stay in-character between game sessions? Sounds good! Online character system to make building your next half-elf warrior a breeze? Sign me up!</p>
			<p>I'm particularly interested in creating complete design solutions for games, from printable character sheets to rules reference mobile apps and from online character creation systems to old-school physical GM screens.</p></p>
