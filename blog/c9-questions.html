      <h4>How to Ask a Good Question</h4>
      <h5>Sunday, February 1, 2015</h5>
      <h6>Step 1: Research!
      <p>Before you ask your question, stop and think. Do I have a resource that likely has the answer to my question? Take a look at a book, your notes, or Google the question you have. You might be delighted to find an answer to your question without even asking it! This is great for errors or syntax issues, but less fantastic for understanding of broad concepts. Especially if your question doesn't necessarily have a "right" answer, you might need to seek out an answer and guidance from a real, live human being.</p>
      <h6>Step 2: Formulate your question</h6>
      <p>Figure out what it is you're really asking about. You might be perplexed as to why your code isn't working, but the real problem might be that you don't understand the challenge you're trying to solve, or maybe you don't understand how the concept you're using really works. If you find that your problem is more broad than it appears, keep that in mind. If your question is about something very specific, that's good to understand, too. This will help you later.</p>
      <h6>Step 3: Figure out who to ask!</h6>
      <p>Think about how you learn best and what is most convenient for you at this time. Do you want a lot of opinions and time isn't an issue? Consider StackOverflow or another coding site. Do you understand answers best when you're discussing them in person or you need an answer right away? Grab a cohort member or staff and get to asking. Consider the expertise and openness of the people you'd like to ask. Make sure they have time, too.</p>
      <h6>Step 4: Set up the question</h6>
      <p>If you're asking the question online, make sure you give it a clear and descriptive title. Include the language you're using and a short version of your question. Provide relevant information about your operating system, platform, or other software. In person and online, describe why you're asking the question by providing information about your problem and how you encountered it. Context can be key to getting a helpful answer and it helps your answerer understand your needs.</p>
      <h6>Step 5: Ask the question</h6>
      <p>Finally, ask your question, providing as much of your code as is relevant. Be clear and detailed, but don't go off on a confusing tangent that might distract your answerer from the real problem. If asking the question online, make sure to proofread what you've written to make sure it all make sense.</p>
      <h6>Step 6: Get your answer</h6>
      <p>Respond to any questions asked of you promptly and be honest if you're unsure of an answer. If you've been given multiple answers, compare them and see how they might supplement each other. Of course, thank people for useful answers and their time.</p>
