or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Github

===========

Hey there, beautiful fellow newbies! Reflecting back on this first week of Dev Bootcamp, I realize that I've made some pretty big leaps in my technical knowledge. Just a few weeks ago, I found myself summarizing to a friend why DBC was so cool, including that "Unlike some CS degree programs, they actually teach us why version control is so important!" My friend, ever the snarky pedant, said, "Oh, yeah? Well, why is version control so important, then?" I sat in silence for a moment, realizing that I should probably know what I'm talking about before I start trying to make myself look a coding genius, "Well, they haven't taught me yet!"

No excuses, now though! Maybe I should go back to my snarky friend and explain that version control is so cool because it allows us to track and manage what changes have been made to a file. If we want to revert back to a previous version of our code, no problem! Does an older version work better? Did you find a mistake in the current code and you're not sure when it was introduced? Maybe you just want to look back on your older, crappier code and marvel at how it's improved? Through the power of version control, we can address these issues.

"Man, version control does sound pretty nifty, Stephanie. But how do I start?" Well, imaginary reader, you need to *git* yourself something to manage your versions for you!

Git is software that helps you keep track of your changes; simply tell it what directory on your computer to take a look at, and it will notice when changes have been made. When you add or remove a file or make changes to an existing one, git will notice. For each change, you can tell git to ignore the change or commit it as the most updated version of the file. If you want to know what change you made, when you made a change, or revert back to a previous version, Git can help you out.

"But Stephanie, I get lonely sometimes and like to work with other people! How can I use version control with files I want to work on with other humans?" Good question! I'd recommend you use a magical place on the internet called GitHub! GitHub is a place you can tell git to push your file changes to, instead of just letting them sit on your computer. Other people can pull your files from GitHub to their local machine, make changes, and push their changes back to GitHub. You can all collaborate on code and see who made what change, when they made the change, and (if they've written a helpful commit message) why they made the change. If you've done some work on part of the code and someone else made changes somewhere else in the same file, you can tell git to merge both versions of the file, giving you a file with both sections updated. 

I still have a lot to learn about git and GitHub, but I think I can safely say that I know enough to understand why they're both so useful. Now, I'm off to upload this blog post using the magic of git and GitHub; I'll seeya in my next post!
