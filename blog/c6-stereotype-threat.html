      The Joys of Stereotype Threat</h4>
      <h5>Sunday, January 11, 2015</h5>
      <p>To be clear, stereotype threat is specifically caused by the fear (conscious or not) that one will confirm a negative stereotype about one's group through their actions. This can cause stress, anxiety, or helplessness, which harm performance. Stereotype threat applies only when there is a negative stereotype in one's culture about a group and said group's abilities in a certain area. Studies have provided significant support for the existence of stereotype threat, especially in the case of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). Shockingly, I happen to be a woman in STEM and have been for all of my adult life. I have seen it affect me greatly, even when knowing that it exists.</p>

      <p>I entered undergrad as a bright-eyed 18-year-old woman majoring in physics, hoping to move onto grad school and become an astrophysicist. My university, a technical school, was about 70% male and my major even more male-dominated. I tried a variety of tactics in hopes of not becoming "that stupid girl who's bad at science. Sometimes, when I felt confident I would do well, I presented as very feminine, hoping to show "those guys" and my almost-all-male professors that "girls could do it too!" When I felt more awful and incapable, I dressed plainly, hoping that they'd just forget I was a woman and let me slack off a bit like so many of my classmates did. I'll spare you all the details, but suffice to say that of the people who changed majors from physics, most of us were women.</p>

      <p>I wasn't bad at physics, I just wasn't as great as I thought I should be. Looking back, my grades weren't any worse than plenty of the guys who ended up graduating with a physics degree, and I clearly held myself to too high a standard. Straight A's or nothing, right? So, I switched to psychology, which I did consistently well in. In the psychology department there were (somehow!) about as many women as men and I no longer felt pressure due to my gender.</p>

      <p>Now, in DBC, I wonder: will I feel the "women are bad at STEM" stereotype? There seem to be strong female instructors and my Chicago cohort is roughly half women, so that's a start, right? As much as I wish it weren't possible, all of us will carry in a bit of the outside world, so I'll still need to be aware of the patriarchal pressures pushing women out of programming. (Say that five times fast!) I need to keep reminding myself that I can totally do this. That there are plenty of badass women who code and really rock at it. That I can wear a skirt or makeup to DBC and not feel like I have to prove anything about my gender.</p>
