      <h4>Variable Scope:<br>A Handy Primer</h4>
      <h5>Sunday, January 11, 2015</h5>
<!--       <h6>What is scope?</h6> -->
      <p>Our variables in Ruby can be referenced in many different locations in a program. The range in which a variable can be referenced is called its <i>scope</i>. Ruby has five different variable scopes, each with its own sigil which is attached to the variable.</p>
      <h6>Global variables</h6>
      <p>Global variables can be accessed from anywhere and start with <code>$</code>, for example: <code>$global_value</code>. Uninitialized global variables have the value <code>nil</code>. Using global variables is generally discouraged, for they can easily lead to errors and should only be used when there is a good reason.</p>
      <h6>Constants</h6>
      <p>Constants can be accessed from iniside a class if defined inside a class, otherwise they can be accessed globally. A constant begins with an uppercase letter and is generally written in all caps, for example: <code>CONSTANT</code>. Constants must be initialized with a value and making a change to an already intialized constant will produce a warning. Constants are used for values that (ideally) will not change in the program.</p>
      <h6>Class variables</h6>
      <p>Class variables are valid for all instances of the class they are defined within and start with <code>@@</code>, for example: <code>@@class_variable</code>. Class variables must be initialized before they can be used in a method and referencing an unitialized class variable will produce an error. Class variables are used when you want many instances of a class to share a certain value.</p>
      <h6>Instance variables</h6>
      <p>Instance variables are valid for a single instance of a class and start with <code>@</code>, for example: <code>@instance_variable</code>. Uninitialized instance variables have the value <code>nil</code>. Instance variables are used when you want instances of a class to have different vaues for a certain variable.</p>
      <h6>Local variables</h6>
      <p>Local variables are only valid within a local area of code, such as a method or class. Local variables have no sigil and begin with a lowercase letter or underscore, for example: <code>local_variable</code>. An uninitialized local variable is treated as a call to a method with no arguments.</p>
