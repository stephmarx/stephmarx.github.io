      <h4>Conflict Analysis</h4>
      <h5>Sunday, January 25, 2015</h5>
      <h6>Describe a time I had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?</h6>
      <p>Without giving too much detail, I had a friend who made a racist remark. This friend sometimes said things that were inappropriate, while thinking that they weren't "really" inappropriate. In this case, I called the friend out, saying "not cool." They objected, saying that they didn't understand what was offensive about it, that "It's true, though! It's not racist because it's a fact!" Another friend and I explained that, no, it wasn't a fact and was really not okay. We politely explained as best we could, while trying to be still empathetic with the other person.</p>
      <h6>What was the source of the conflict?</h6>
      <p>The source was myself and a friend disagreeing about what is offensive and inappropriate.</p>
      <h6>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?</h6>
      <p>At the time, I felt frustrated and embarassed. I wanted to educate my friend without hurting their feelings too badly. I wanted to change their mind and help them understand.</p>
      <h6>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?</h6>
      <p>I involved an ally and tried to communicate rationally and calmly.</p>
      <h6>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h6>
      <p>Perhaps I wouldn't react so immediately strongly. I knew that this person probably wouldn't respond well but did it anyways.</p>
      <h6>What did you learn from this experience?</h6>
      <p>I learned a bit about how this person thinks and responds to confrontation. I also learned how much of a useful ally that the other friend was.</p>
      <p>I will type actual text later.</p>
