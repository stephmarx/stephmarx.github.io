  <h1>My Mind As My Biggest Obstacle</h1>

    <h3>My thinking style</h3>
    <p>As a psychology nerd, I loved it when, in our pre-phase-0 prep work, we were asked to determine our Gregorc Thinking Style. After taking a quiz to determine my style, I was completely unsuprised to learn that I scored highly as an abstract thinker, particularly abstract random. Abstract thinkers use their intuition, imagination, and instincts to look for hidden meanings and find relationships between concepts. Random thinkers organize information in groups in a non-linear order and skip procedural steps while still coming to the desired conclusion.</p>
    <p>According to this model of thinking styles abstract random thinkers like to focus on relationships with others and their ideas to come to decisions in groups. They learn best in a personalized setting with broad guidelines for success and, of course, in group settings. So far, this all describes me quite well. I sometimes prefer to work alone, but only when I feel like I could actually accomplish more by myself.</p>
    <h3>Challenges for abstract random thinkers</h3>
    <p>According to Gregorc's model, people with abstract random minds can struggle with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Having to justify feelings</li>
        <li>Competition</li>
        <li>Working with authoritarian personalities</li>
        <li>Working in a restrictive environment</li>
        <li>Working with people who don't seem friendly</li>
        <li>Concentrating on one thing at at time</li>
        <li>Giving exact details</li>
        <li>Accepting even positive criticism</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I find most of those to be challenging, but particularly concentrating on one thing at a time and accepting any criticism. I feel like I've learned to deal with many of these challenges and still produce work as a result of going through the current American educational system, where working in reluctant groups and focusing on a single task can be common. In general, I've learned to work alone and adapt to a learning environment better suiterd to concrete sequential thinkers, but I still instinctively like to deal with issues in an abstract random way.</p>
    <p>Luckily for me, DevBootcamp seems to cater to abstract random types, with its focus on group work and learning concepts instead of specific steps. Previously in my life, being an abstract random thinker had felt like a stumbling block, a negative personality trait to try to overcome.</p>
    <h3>My personal challenge</h3>
    In all honesty, my biggest challenge so far has been sitting down and working. When I have a pairing session scheduled, there's no problem. I get excited and prep for the session, so I have something valuable to contribute to my pair. When I've scheduled time to work by myself, however, I can have a hard time with just <em>working</em> to being with. I have plenty of time to actually do the work, but I sometimes have a hard time getting into a frame of mind where I can concentrate and be productive. </p>
    <p>During week 3, I postponed two of my DBC work days due to feeling down and like I couldn't sit at my computer to do anything worthwhile. It sounds silly when I try to describe it, but it feels so incredibly real when I'm actually in that mood. I suppose, then, I could say that my mental health has been the biggest challenge.</p>
    <p>But, luckily, I know exactly how to deal with this challenge! (See earlier statement re: psychology nerd). I know how to deal with my own mind and emotions and, so far, I've been able to do my best work and feel proud of what I've done.</p>
    <h3>Growth vs fixed mindset</h3>
    <p>Fixed mindset: the belief that your knowledge and skills can't be improved</p>
    <p>Growth mindeset: the beief that your knowledge can skills can improve over time</p>
    <p>I'm sure it seems obvious that a growth mindset seems much healthier and more likely to lead to success, but it's another thing entirely to actually completely adopt a growth mindset. For a very long time, I consciously held a fixed mindset, believing that I already had the skills and knowledge I needed to do what I wanted to do and that everything would just work out. I didn't study or work on improving myself and got along just fine for quite a while.</p>
    <p>Then, things stopped, well, "just working." I had to learn how to study and how to practice and found myself in a pretty bad place, mentally. I had believed for such a long time that I was as good as I was going to be, that it felt awful when I wasn't as good at things as I wanted to be. It took several years and several failed attempts at success to transition to a growth mindset. Instead of just having a desire to look smart, I now have a desire to learn and improve my skills. I still have to actively remind myself that it's okay to struggle and feel frustrated, that it means I'm really learning something. It's taken a while to learn that I should make mistakes early and often to learn, instead of never making a mistake to succeed.</p>
    <p>So, what does this all mean for me in DBC? I feel like I'm having to really be conscious of my thoughts, emotions, and body in order to feel like I'm doing my best. I shouldn't feel ashamed that I've made mistakes and had some rough days in the last three weeks. That just means I'm learning.</p>
