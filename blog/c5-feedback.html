      <h4>My Thoughts on Feedback</h4>
      <h5>Sunday, January 4, 2015</h5>
      <h6>Pairing</h6>
      <p>I've really enjoyed pairing with others to solve challenges. Although it seems like I take longer to complete the work when pairing, I think that I end up with a much better understanding of the material from pairing. I learn best when I can explain my thoughts and ideas out loud and get immediate feedback on my progress, so pairing has been super helpful. When I'm working alone, I don't always realize my mistakes or misunderstandings right away, and pairing helps correct me much sooner.</p>
      <p>I find that I've been seeking out people to pair with based on how active they are in the Google+ community and how much we communicate outside of pairing. When my pair and I choose each other (as opposed to assigned GPS partners), I've had a fantastic experience. My partners have been eager to pair and excited to work on the material and I've been really lucky. It will be interesting to see how pairing feels when I'm onsite and paired with someone who's perhaps less eager.</p>
      <h6>Feedback</h6>
      <p>I should note here that the feedback on Socrates really isn't anonymous; it's very easy to figure out who wrote what feedback for me and I suspect it's equally easy to figure out when feedback comes from me. This hasn't been an issue for me, as I've still felt comfortable giving honest, useful, and kind feedback.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, when I write feedback, though, I feel uncertain of what to write. I try very hard to stay within the guidelines DBC has given us for feedback, and my feedback has been rated highly on Socrates probably as a result of this. Still, I feel like I have a hard time figuring out what to say for some people, especially when we've paired before or when our session was very short. In the future, some example good feedback from DBC would be useful.</p>
      <p>I feel a little frustrated with some of my feedback, as I wish that my pairs had just told me about their frustrations during the session, so I could fix things immediately. Some of my feedback, for example, said that the text on my screen during screensharing was too small to read and that I should fix that in the future. I would have liked them to tell me immediately during the session so I could make their experience better. Another person mentioned that I sometimes checked in on trivial bits of code and said I shouldn't do that in the future. Again, mentioning "hey, it's alright, I trust you to make good decisions, you don't have to check in" would have made the session more comfortable for the both of us. I try to mention isssues during the session if they're simple fixes, and I hope that more of my pairs will do this in the future.</p>
      <p>Since getting feedback like that, I've made sure to tell my partners at the beginning of each session to let me know if they have any concerns or issues with how things are going and that I value communication between us. It's helped, I think, and I've gotten actionable feedback in the moment, which has improved my pairing sessions.</p>
      <p>Aside from that frustrating type of feedback, I've felt really great when reading feedback! I've gotten really great actionable suggestions and a decent amount of compliments on my attitude and technical knowledge. Hearing that other people think I know what I'm doing has really helped me combat imposter syndrome.</p>
