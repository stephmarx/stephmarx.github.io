      <h4>The Classiest Blog Entry Yet</h4>
      <h5>Sunday, January 4th, 2015</h5>
      <p>We can use classes to create our own, brand-spankin-new types objects within Ruby. When we initialize the class, we determine what properites the objects in that class will have and we can even write our own class methods to determine some things we can do with those objects.</p>
      <p>Let's say I want to store and change information about some Dungeons and Dragons characters in a game I'm running. I can do this by creating my own class called Character:</p>
      <code>
        class Character<br>
          def initialize(race, class, level, name)<br>
            @race = race<br>
            @class = class<br>
            @level = level<br>
            @name = name<br>
          end<br>
      </code>
      <p>Here, I've created my class and defined the method for initializing this class. Specifically, when we create a new character, we need to give its race, class, level, and name, like so:</p>
      <code>
        Valdrox = Character.new(orc, fighter, 17, Valdrox)
      </code>
      <p>So far, so good. As part of initializing this class, I created four instance variables (race, class, level, and name) that we can use across other class methods. We've used the Character class to store some information about Valdrox in these instance variables. What if we want to change these instance variables?</p>
      <code>
        attr_accessor :race :class :level :name
      </code>
      <p>When I define the class, I can declare which variables associated with the class can be read and written to. Here, I've chosen to make these variables both readable and writable with <code>attr_accessor</code>. So, what else can I do, now that I've created a character?</p>
      <code>
        def level_up<br>
          @level +=<br>
          puts "Congrats, you've gained a level!"<br>
        end<br>
        <br>
        def who_am_i<br>
        puts "#{name} is a level #{level} character and is a #{race} #{class}."<br>
        end<br>
      </code>
      <p>Here, I've defined a class method that levels up the character by changing the <code>@level</code> value. I've also created a method that returns the informaiton about the character we've given so far. Let's see how all these methods look together as part of the class declaration:</p>
      <code>
          class Character<br>
          attr_accessor :race :class :level :name<br>
          <br>
          def initialize(race, class, level, name)<br>
            @race = race<br>
            @class = class<br>
            @level = level<br>
            @name = name<br>
          end<br>
          <br>
        def level_up<br>
          @level +=<br>
          puts "Congrats, you've gained a level!"<br>
        end<br>
        <br>
        def who_am_i<br>
        puts "#{name} is a level #{level} character and is a #{race} #{class}."<br>
        end<br>
      </code>
      <p>So, if we enter the following:</p>
      <code>
        Arwyn = Character.new(Elf, Druid, 3, Arwyn)<br>
        puts Arwyn.level_up<br>
        puts Arwyn.who_am_i<br>
      </code>
      <p>Our code would return:</p>
      <code>
        "Congrats, you've gained a level!"<br>
        "Arwyn is a level 4 character and is a Elf Druid."
      </code>
