      <h4>LGBT Discrimination in the Technology Industry</h4>
      <h5>Sunday, December 14, 2014</h5>
      <p>Yes, you read that title right. Gender and sexual minorities are still being discriminated against in the tech world. Yes, <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/microsoft-apple-tech-titans-get-top-marks-survey-lgbt-inclusion-policies/">Silicon Valley is the home of many of the top scorer's on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index</a>. Yes, Apple's CEO Tim Cook <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/10/30/tim-cook-comes-out/18165361/">recently came out as gay</a>. And yes, tons of technology industry leaders participate in gay pride parades around the country. So, good enough, right? Let's go fight the good fight somewhere else? We LGBT folks have nothing to worry about in the tech field!</p>
      <p>Not true, sadly. Pro-LGBT-rights corporate policies certainly help, but as Edward Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, recently said in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/technology/tim-cooks-disclosure-that-hes-gay-garners-sweeping-praise.html?_r=0">an interview</a> with the New York Times, "But down at the rank-and-file level is where these policies are put into practice, and that's where many of us fall short. ...[T]he majority of people have good intentions, but inadvertently create an unwelcoming environment for people who are not like them."</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/fashion/silicon-valley-embrace-gay-and-lesbian-community.html">Some people</a> in tech feel that the industry, as a whole, is still uncomfortable with LGBT people, reporting they see more "cluelessness" than homophobia, appearing shocked when they learn that a colleague might be gay. Especially in the female sphere of tech (which is still a minority), lesbians aren't even a consideration. In an interview with the New York Times, Leanne Pittsford, a founder of Lesbians Who Tech, said, "When I go to a women's event, it's very heterosexual. When there's a panel of women and they talk about 'Lean In' and Sheryl Sandberg, and they talk about their husbands and how he should be supportive. That's oustide of lesbians' experiences." Women in tech are already highly marginalized, and lesbians even more so, as both queer and female.</p>
      <p>Tech employees are also careful to point out that there's a big difference between being openly embraced and taken seriously in the industry. For transgender people in particular, it can be difficult to deal with coworkers who simply don't understand their identity and don't take them seriously as a result. Although many tech giants have corporate policies to prevent discrimination, the culture of many tech companies has not yet changed. Large corporations can't afford to discriminate against their employees, but many tech startups just don't seem to care. In <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/trans-challenges-to-the-tech-world">an interview with Model View Culture</a>, several transgender and nonbinary tech employees reported feeling "very, very afraid to express anything" about themselves in technology startups, as opposed to larger companies. They also noted "how poorly managers and supervisors -- if there are any -- at startups are trained to deal with LGBT and queer issues, which can further fuel the culture of brash teenage boy behavior.</p>
      <p>Compared to other industries, technology is generally on the forefront of developments in LGBT rights. We still have work to do, though. If you're an LGBT person wanting to navigate the technology sphere or an ally wanting to learn how to help, there are plenty of resources. I recommend taking a look at <a href="http://www.outintech.com/">Out in Tech</a>, <a href="http://lesbianswhotech.org/">Lesbians Who Tech</a>, <a href="http://lgbttechpartnership.org/">The LGBT Technology Partnership</a>, and <a href="http://startout.org/">StartOut</a>.
