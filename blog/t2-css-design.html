  <h4>KINGDOM.HTML<br>How the Stubborn King Learned to Use Classes and IDs in His CSS</h4>
  <h5>Saturday, November 29 2014</h5>

    <p>Once upon a time, there was magical kingdom in a faraway land called KINGDOM.HTML. The most talented of all the citizens of KINGDOM.HTML lived in the capitol city, CAPITOL.CSS and all of them had very important jobs given to them by their King.</p>
    <p>Some of them were painters, who could change the color of any item in the kingdom at a moment's notice. Others were scribes, specialized in changing the design of the words in every ancient tome and sign. Still more of them were builders, who moved around the very stones of the castle itself. All them were incredibly talented and incredibly specialized at their work.</p>
    <p>The King of KINGDOM.HTML, however, found himself frequently frustrated with his workers, as he gave very vague instructions to his workers. Builders would be sent to "move stones to the left." Painters would be asked to "make circles red." Scribes would be sent to "make words cursive." Without specific direction, the workers of CAPITOL.CSS diligently did their duty and worked on anything that could meet the description of what the King had ordered.</p>
    <p>The King, frustrated by how ugly and confusing KINGDOM.HTML had become, called for a meeting of the heads of all the guilds, pleading with them for help. "KINGDOM.HTML is a mess!" he cried. "Everything's in the wrong spot and just plain ugly! Why are all the words everywhere all squiggly and hard to read?! Why is everything moved around?! Why don't you all just do what I ask you to do?!"</p>
    <p>After much murmuring amongst the assembled guildsmen, a young woman from the Builders Guild spoke up. "Perhaps, your majesty, you could tell us what to do a bit more precisely."</p>
    <p>"WHAT?! What do you mean?!" angrily asked the King. "I always tell you builders to change the buildings! Isn't that what you people are supposed to do?!"</p>
    <p>"Well, yes," replied the woman, "but you don't tell us what type of building we should work on! You just say 'move some bricks'!"</p>
    <p>"Well, I, uh, but--" protested the King.</p>
    <p>The guildsmen began to murmur once more. "That's right!" they said. "Things have names, you know!"</p>
    <p>"QUIET!" shouted the King. "IF IT'S NAMES YOU REQUIRE THEN IT'S NAMES I SHALL USE!" He stormed off in a huff, frustrated at how particular they were, but secretly happy that they had found a solution to implement.</p>
    <p>And implement it he did. The next day, whenever the King gave a command, he explained the class of object that the workers should change. Instead of telling a painter to "make circles red," he requested that "for portraits: make circles red". Instead of requesting that "stones move to the left", he asked that "for schools: move stones to the left." Instead of asking that they "make words cursive", he asked "for title page of books, make words cursive." The workers again followed his instructions as best as they could.</p>
    <p>Still, the King was unhappy and called for another meeting of the Guilds. "No no NO!" he shouted, stamping his feet. "That's closer, but still not what I meant! Don't you people know anything?! Explain yourselves!"</p>
    <p>The same woman from the Buiders Guild spoke up, "Well, your majesty, you gave us more specific instructions, but they weren't quite specific enough. Exactly <i>which</i> school did you want us to move the bricks for?"</p>
    <p>"Well, I, uh... Hm. I see," murmured the King. "I suppose telling you which school I mean might help. But what if I want you to change something about every item in a certain class of thing? What then, smartypants?!"</p>
    <p>"Well," she said, pondering his question, "perhaps you tell us the class of thing we should change when you want us to change many things and the name of a specific thing when you want only that changed?"</p>
    <p>The King was silent, surprised that there was such an elegant solution to this problem that he hadn't seen before. "Hmmm..." said the King, stroking his beard, "that might just work."</p>
    <p>And so the King learned that being specific with his workers was incredibly useful when he wanted them to do specific tasks. When he wanted something done to every object, he told his workers so. When he wanted something done to a specific type of objects, he told his workers the class of objects to work on. And when he wanted something done to just one object in particular, he told them the name of that particular object. Soon, KINGDOM.HTML looked just how the King wanted it to and all the workers in CAPITOL.CSS were once more pleased with their King. And they all lived happily ever after, obviously.</p>
    <p>THE END</p><br>

    <h4>The Moral of the Story!</h4>
    <p>When you're using CSS to change the look of an HTML document, give names to the parts of the HTML you want to change and reference them in the CSS. If you want to style many parts of the HTML, give those parts a specific class name and reference it in the CSS. If you just want to style one particular part of the HTML, give it an ID and reference it in the CSS.</p>
