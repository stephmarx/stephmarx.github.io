      <h4>Remembering to Value Myself</h4>
      <h5>Saturday, January 17, 2015</h5>
      <h6>Exploring my values</h6>
      <p>Alrighty, so, let's think. When I think of the times in my life when I've been the happiest, the proudest, or most satisified, which values come to mind? Of the list presented by DevBootcamp, I picked the following: close relationships, creativity, inspiration, pleasure, recognition, and self-respect. Okay, so, how much do I try to live up to these values, from a scale of 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree)?</p>
      <p>Close relationships - Strongly agree, 5. I feel fantastic when I have people around me who I can talk to, receive reciprocal support, and have fun with. I'm proud when I can help a friend and feel satisifed when I'm reminded that people care for me.</p>
      <p>Creativity - Agree, 4. Creating something really helps with my anxiety and depression, but I sometimes forget how good it makes me feel. I'm proud when I can be creative and appreciate what I've done. Even if what I've made isn't particularly well-done or exciting, I still feel happy that I've made something myself. I feel especially proud when I think of clever and unique ideas.</p>
      <p>Inspiration - Strongly agree, 5. I frequently look for inspiration for creative endeavors and feel very excited when I get some new, exciting idea. I love to read blogs and reddit threads looking for exciting ideas and keep gigs and gigs of inspirational ideas. I don't always act on my inspiration, but still enjoy hoarding it. I have all sorts of creative tools to help inspire me to make things. I love owning and seeing beautiful and strange things for the inspiring ideas they give me.</p>
      <p>Pleasure - Agree, 4. I sometimes forget to just do what makes me happy and makes me feel good, but it's something I've been working on for the past few years. In the past, I held different values based on a false idea of what made me happy, proud, and satisfied. After a lot of struggle, I realized that I need to not completely neglect my own pleasure and instead just remember what makes me feel good. It's okay to eat a cupcake or buy something silly if it makes me happy. This isn't rated at a 5 because I still struggle to remind myself about just being happy.</p>
      <p>Recognition - Strongly agree, 5. Boy, do I love it when people recognize what I do! I really appreciate it when someone notices my acting ability or coding skills or hair color or interior decorating or anything and compliments me on it. I can be just plain awful at complimenting myself and can be overly critical, and it really reminds me that I'm actually good at things when it comes from an external source. It also feel great to have my effort recognized and makes my actions and thoughts feel worthwhile.</p>
      <p>Self-respect - Neutral, 3. I actively know that I feel great when I think good things about myself and don't worry so much, but that's pretty hard to do sometimes. I don't treat myself as well as I should.</p>

      <h6>Giving advice</h6>
      <p>The last topic someone asked me for advice on was how well they ran a tabletop gaming session. It definitely related to some of the values I found important:
      <ul>
        <li>Close relationships - The person who asked me for this advice was one of my good friends. I was excited to give him feedback and make him feel good by telling him how great his game was.</li>
        <li>Creativity - I have a lot of thoughts and opinions on roleplaying games and playing them is my favorite creative activity.</li>
        <li>Recognition - My friend valued my opinion and specifically asked me to play in his game because he was very interested to hear feedback from me. It made me feel like he appreciates what I do and has noticed my roleplaying skills.</li>
      </ul></p>

      <h6>Values and stereotype threat</h6>
      <p>I feel proud of my values. Recognizing and reaffirming my values has been a difficult path and admitting to myself what was actually important to me was difficult. Previously, I felt pressured to have an entirely different value set, and I felt embarassed and ashamed to value creativity and relationships and pleasure. I felt that I needed to value logic and order success, as opposed to "fluffier" concepts. Now though, I'm much happier as a result of prioritizing what's really important to me.</p>
      <p>I need to remember that these values are what make me happy, not being perfect and quiet and fitting into a box. If stereotype threat makes me feel like there's a certain way that women or queer folks need to behave, I need to tell stereotype threat to get out of my head. I need to remember that there are plenty of people that like me for who I am and that I like me for who I am. I don't need to shut up and be perfectly logical and let someone else be in charge of me. I need to be inspired and creative and do awesome things that I like to do.</p>
      <p>There are a lot of exercises I should use to help me when I'm feeling down onsite at DBC. I really should make a list of things that make me feel happier, and use it when I'm feeling down onsite. I should take deep breaths and slow down. I should take a break to make something simple or to look at something pretty. I should contact a friend just to say hi. I should remember that going to onsite does not turn me into a coding machine, that I'm still a person who should take care of herself.</p>
