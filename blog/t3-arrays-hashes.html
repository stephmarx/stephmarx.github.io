  <h4>Arrays and Hashes:<br>A Bunch of Little Boxes</h4>
  <h5>Sunday, December 7, 2014</h5>

    <h6>What is an array?</h6>
    <p>An array is just a numbered list stored in your computer. Each slot within the array functions like a variable; you can put an object into the slot and reference later using the name of the slot. For example:</p>
    <code>
      places = ['Anchorage', 'Chicago', 'Greenhaven']<br>
      puts places[0]<br>
      puts places[1]<br>
      puts places[2]
    </code>
    <p>This code returns:</p>
    <code>
      Anchorage<br>
      Chicago<br>
      Greenhaven
    </code>
    <p>In this example, I first declared the array, which I called <code>places</code>. (There are several different ways to declare an array; this is just a simple example.) As part of this delcaration, I named three objects in the array immediately and then told the computer to output whatever is stored in slots 0, 1, and 2. (Note that arrays start counting with the number 0, not 1.) The computer then returned the values I had previously stored in slots 0, 1, and 2. It's important to note that, unless you specify otherwise, that the array will store the information in the order you presented it in.</p>
    <p>I can add additional objects to this array:</p>
    <code>
      places[3] = 'Los Angeles'<br>
      places[4] = 'New York'
    </code><br><br>
    <h3>Why use an array?</h3>
    <p>Arrays are useful when you have a bunch of information you'd like to work with, such as email addresses or test scores. Instead of storing each piece of information in its own variable, they can all be kept in an array, which is very easy to reference with index numbers. There are also lots of useful things you can do to an array, such as sort the words in it alphabetically, which would be very difficult to do if your information was stored in lots of separate variables.</p>
    <p>What if I want to know more about the stuff in the array, though?</p><br>
    <h3>What is a hash?</h3>
    <p>When we store information in an array, we can later refer to it using its index in the array, which is always a number. When we store information, in a hash, however, we refer to it using its key, which can be any type information we want it to be.</p>
    <p>Think of the slots within an array or a hash as a bunch of boxes. If I want to tell you where I put something in an array, I'd tell you which numbered box it's in. If I want to tell you where I put something in a hash, I'd tell you that it was in a box labeled something like 'address' or 'cat'.</p>
    <p>Let's see this in action:</p>
    <code>
      my_favorite = {<br>
        game => "Minecraft"<br>
        food => "pasta"<br>
        restaurant => "Taco Bell"<br>
        number => 1353<br>
    }
    </code>
    <p>In this example, I declared the hash <code>my_favorite</code> and immediately named some key-value pairs in the hash. The items on the left (game, food, restaurant, and number) are my keys. The items to the right of the <code>=></code> arrows are my values. Think of the keys as the label on the box and the values as the contents of the box. I can use the keys to do things with the values:</p>
    <code>
      puts my_favorite["game"]<br>
      puts my_favorite["number"]
    </code>
    <p>This returns the vallues associated with each key:</p>
    <code>
      Minecraft<br>
      1353
    </code><br><br>
    <h3>Why use a hash instead of an array?</h3>
    <p>Think back to our box example. If we're using an array and I want to have you get a particular item from a box, I have to know the number of the box the item is in. If we're using a hash, however, I just have to remember what the label on the outside of the box is.</p>
    <p>An array is useful when we just have a bunch of information we want to do something with, like finding the average of a bunch of SAT scores. If we want to remember who got what ACT score, though, we need to have some way of labeling each score with a person's name, so a hash would be ideal.</p>
